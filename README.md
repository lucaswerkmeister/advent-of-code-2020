# Advent of Code 2020

My (Lucas Werkmeister’s) solutions for [Advent of Code 2020][aoc2020].
Peruse this repository at your own risk for spoilers, of course.

The directory for each day contains a `solve` script,
which can generally be run to more or less get the solution;
sometimes the script requires the path to the input file as an argument,
or occasionally it needs to be piped into `wc -l` or something similar
to obtain the final, summarized answer.

The committed solutions are generally for the part 2 of each day’s puzzle;
the part 1 solution is either some kind of dead code
(commented out, unused function, etc.)
or can only be found in the Git history.
